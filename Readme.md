To use this application, you will need to have Python 3.x, Linux operating system and Docker installed on your machine.

You will also need the solver that we this appliction uses to run some of it's functions:
The solver I used is a docker image which can be pulled using the following command: docker pull odinaldo/eqargsolver

The python libraries declared in the requirements.txt file should also be installed in your system. All of these libraries can be installed using the pip command.

Once all the requirements have been installed: you may start the application by typing "streamlit run visualizer.py"

Once you have got familiar with the UI, when trying to do a computation by clicking on "Run computation", the terminal may ask for sudo password. You will need to provide it once every time the application is in session.
